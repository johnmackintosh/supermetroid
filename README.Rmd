This packaged analysis accompanies [PyData Copenhagen June 2023](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-copenhagen/events/294210771/)  is best viewed on the [package site](https://softloud.github.io/supermetroid).

Super Metroid speed run data is captured from leaderboards, and analysed to answer the following question, posed by `anatomecha`, a Super Metroid speed runner. 

> `anatomecha`: At what times do Super Metroid 100% speed runs get competitive?

# What is Super Metroid?

> While the exploration-focused platformers known as Metroidvanias derive their genre name from two different series, there’s one game they’re all judged by. Super Metroid wasn’t the first Metroidvania, the first Metroid game also had the focus on exploring a large interconnected map and using new abilities to open up new areas, but its polish, visual direction, and atmosphere all created a more involved experience than its predecessors. Released in 1994, Super Metroid’s shadow looms over every game in the genre since... - [thegamehoard 2022](https://thegamehoard.com/2022/04/24/50-years-of-video-games-super-metroid-snes/)

## Super Metroid speed running

As part of the verification of their speed run results, many players upload a video of the run to youtube. Here is `anatomecha` speed running Super Metroid and capturing time points.

This analysis focuses on 100% speedruns wherein players traverse a map using different routes to collect all loot and defeat all bosses. Speed runners try to do this as fast as possible, and log their results on leaderboards such as [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/supermetroid?h=100&x=xd1mpewd) or splitsio.  

A core feature of the game is that there are many routes through the map. These routes are often hidden in seemingly impassable walls, or require solving a puzzle. 

```{r fig.cap="image source: metroid.retropixel.net"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://metroid.retropixel.net/games/metroid3/metroid3_map.gif")

```

Speed runners hone their skills by mastering techniques to improve their speed in collecting all loot and defeating all bosses in a 100% run through of the game. 

## Example: Load speedrun.com leaderboard data and visualise distribution

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# install R-packaged analysis
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("softloud/supermetroid")



```

```{r echo=TRUE}
# example: access speedrun.com leaderboard
library(supermetroid) # analysis code

# take a look at observations
src_df %>% head()

# visualise observations in a raincloud plot
src_df %>% 
  all_run_raincloud(
    lowest_rank = 580,
    font_size = 15 # set font size
  )

# how to do all this in Python?
# so much to learn

```

## Tools used in this analysis


```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Other R packages used in this document
library(tidyverse) # data science tools
library(gt) # for html tables
library(ggraph) # graphs
library(tidygraph) # graphs


```

## The data

```{r}
# load datasets from supermetroid

# key datasets
data("src_df") # speedrun.com leaderboard
data("sio_df") # splits.io player timepoints

# engineered data
data("from_to_df") # tidygraph format

```

Player rankings are sourced from [speedrun.com](https://speedrun.com/)'s leaderboard.

```{r echo=TRUE}
src_df %>% head()

```

In addition to ranking data from speedrun.com's leaderboards, this analysis incorporates timepoints observed for game events (of the player's choosing, frustratingly). 

Speed runners use an open source plugin for the open source emulator favoured by SNES Super Metroid (1994) speed runners. 

```{r out.width="40%", echo=TRUE}
# whyfor error?
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/splits_screenshot.PNG")
```

These observations are captured in a .lss file that can be uploaded to [splitsio](https://splits.io/).  

```{r echo=TRUE}
sio_df %>% head()

```


### Open Python speed runner API implementations

Jeremy Silver maintains a Python implentation [`splitsio`](https://github.com/jeremander/splitsio) of the [REST API](https://github.com/glacials/splits-io/blob/master/docs/api.md) that provides players' timepoint observations of game events from [splitsio](https://splits.io/). @jeremander's consultation on this analysis provided key answers to questions of [what was and was not possible with the data](https://github.com/jeremander/splitsio/issues/1).     

Player ranks from speedrun.com were accessed via the Python implementation [`srcomapi`](https://github.com/blha303/srcomapi) of the [REST API](https://github.com/speedruncomorg/api) for [speedrun.com](https://speedrun.com/).

# Analyses (work in progress)

## Speed run times from speedrun.com

```{r }

all_run_raincloud(font_size = 15, lowest_rank = 580)

```

```{r}
src_df %>% 
  head() %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(
    title = "speedrun.com leaderboard data"
  )
```


### Where are Super Metroid players?

```{r}
sm_world()

```

## Routes players take

### Different routes

```{r}
cum_t_route_vis(font_size = 10) + ylim(0, 200)

```

### Missingness of routes

#### Exploratory graphs

```{r}
from_to_gg <- 
  from_to_df %>% 
  as_tbl_graph()

```

##### Too messy

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
from_to_gg %>% 
  ggraph() +
  geom_edge_fan(aes(size = runs))
  

```

##### Need order


```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
from_to_gg %>%
  ggraph(layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) +
  geom_edge_fan(aes(size = runs), alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = ))


```


##### Need direction


```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
from_to_df %>%
  ggraph(layout = "linear") +
  geom_edge_fan(aes(size = runs), alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_node_point()


```

##### Too many nodes for EDA

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8} 
from_to_df %>% 
  ggraph::ggraph(layout = "linear") +
  ggraph::geom_edge_arc(arrow = arrow(), aes(alpha = runs)) 


```


```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
route_graph(font_size = 15)


```

#### Analysis graph

  
```{r fig.height=5,fig.width=7}
route_graph(selected_splits = c("varia suit", "phantoon", "space jump", "ridley", "golden 4", "grapple beam"))
```


## Route clusters

```{r fig.height=8}
ranked_runs("ice beam", font_size = 15) + xlim(0, 130)

```

```{r fig.height=8}
ranked_runs("grapple beam", font_size = 15) + xlim(0, 130)


```


## Super Metroid and speed running



### Super Metroid is the top SNES speed runner game

```{r}
top_five_vis(text_scale = 10)

```

- [ ] convert to coloured barchart, grouped by game, coloured by category
- [ ] how can we scrape these data?


### Subway Surfers TikTok phenomenon or good upload interface?

```{r }
top_games_vis(text_scale = 10)
```
