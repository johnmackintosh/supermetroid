This is an analysis repository accompanies [PyData Copenhagen June 2023](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-copenhagen/events/294210771/). Super Metroid speed run data is captured from leaderboards, and analysed to answer the following question, posed by a player, that is, a Super Metroid speed runner. 

> At what times do Super Metroid 100% speed runs get competitive?

# What is Super Metroid?

> While the exploration-focused platformers known as Metroidvanias derive their genre name from two different series, there’s one game they’re all judged by. Super Metroid wasn’t the first Metroidvania, the first Metroid game also had the focus on exploring a large interconnected map and using new abilities to open up new areas, but its polish, visual direction, and atmosphere all created a more involved experience than its predecessors.

## Super Metroid speed running

As part of the verification of their speed run results, many players upload a [video of the run](https://www.youtube.com/embed/7-cj22T2Yu4) to youtube.

### Vignettes

Vignette|Description|Output data
-|-
data schema | Plan for what data to extract for analysis |
player-rank | Combine speedrun.com and splits.io data | `splits_df`
src | Scrape supermetroid.com data using `srcomapi` | `src_df`
sio | Scrape splits.io data using `splitsio`; data is not labelled in this vignette. Raw data. | `sio_splits_df`
splits | Use anatomecha's labels to update split strings | `sio_df`, `anatomecha_splist`, `sio_routes_wide`
route-matching | Explore the missingness of routes recorded by players | `distinct_routes`
route-graph | Graphs of routes players take | 
identifying-routes | Classifying routes players take | 
player-locations | Exploring differences in players across locations | 

### Speed run times from speedrun.com

```{r }

all_run_raincloud(base_size = 15)

```

- [ ] interpretable x axis

```{r}
data("src_df")

top_100 <- src_df %>% 
  filter(rank <= 100) 

top_100 %>% 
  all_run_raincloud(xmin = min(top_100$t_s) / 60, xmax = max(top_100$t_s)/ 60) +
  labs(title = "Top 100 Super Metroid 100% speed run times" %>% str_wrap(40))


```



### Where are Super Metroid players?

```{r}
sm_world()

```

## Routes players take

### Different routes

```{r}
cum_t_route_vis(base_size = 10)

```

### Missingness of routes

#### Exploratory graphs

```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5}


```

#### Analysis graph


```{r}
ranked_runs("ice beam", base_size = 10)

```


## Super Metroid and speed running



### Super Metroid is the top SNES speed runner game

```{r}
top_five_vis(base_size = 10)

```

- [ ] convert to coloured barchart, grouped by game, coloured by category
- [ ] how can we scrape these data?


### Subway Surfers TikTok phenomenon or good upload interface?

```{r }
top_games_vis(base_size = 10)
```
