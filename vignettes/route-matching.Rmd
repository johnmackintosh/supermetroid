    # ensure data is arranged by run, ordered by segment time
    arrange(run_id, realtime_end_ms) %>% 
    # why is player name a list?

    # filter to common splits shared by players

    nest(data = supermetroid_label) %>% 
    rename(route = data)

# get distinct routes and their corresponding run_ids
distinct_routes <-
  run_routes %>%
  group_by(route) %>% 
  nest(.key = "run_id") %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(route_id = paste("route ", 1:n())) %>%

head(distinct_routes)

```

```


In these data we have `r nrow(run_routes)` runs that use `r nrow(distinct_routes)` routes, but subroutes are considered separate routes. Which isn't quite what I want, i.e., a route containing a single label is considered distinct from every other route that it is a label from.  

We want to know the number of classes of route, that contain every subroute. Single labels can't be considered (except via classification, I'm thinking some kind of centroid thing). 

- [ ] todo single label analysis to classify by routes

But here we are to do the easy routes, i.e., route = a,b,d, should be considered the same as route a,b,c,d, instead of different, which the `r nrow(distinct_routes)` routes counts. So, how many actual routes are represented, and how many runs can we not classify?

```{r}
viable_routes <-
  # filter out routes of length 1
  distinct_routes %>% 
  mutate(route_length = map_int(route, nrow)) %>% 
  filter(route_length > 1) %>% 
  ungroup()

head(viable_routes)
```

Filtering by routes greater than 1, we have `r nrow(viable_routes)` different routes and subroutes.

## Identifying if one route is a subset and same permutation of another

We want to compare two arbitrary routes, $r_1$ and $r_2$, and ask is $r_1$ a subroute of $r_2$? 

Choose two routes. We know that two runs with routes the same size and with the same size are already collapsed by the `nest`.  

```{r}
(two_routes <-
  viable_routes %>% 
  sample_n(2))

```

Now assign the first of the longest route to primary route, and the other route to the possible subroute of the comparison route. 

```{r}

(comparison_route <- two_routes %>% 
  filter(route_length == max(route_length)) %>% 
  head(1) %>% 
  pull(route_id))

(possible_subroute <- two_routes %>% 
  filter(route != comparison_route) %>% 
  pull(route_id))

```


If the two routes are the same length, but in a different order, they are considered distinct routes, that is, $r_1$ is not a subroute of $r_2$.

```{r}
# check if the two routes are the same length
two_routes$route_length[1] == two_routes$route_length[2]

```

Since the routes are not of the same length, we need to check if $r_1$, that is `possible_subroute` is a subroute of $r_2$, `comparison_route`. 

Let's inspect the routes.

```{r}
two_routes %>% pull(route)
```

## Check if routes are in the same order

```{r}
# figure out comparable ordering of routes

pivoted_routes <- 
  two_routes %>% 
    arrange(desc(route_length)) %>% 
    unnest(route) %>% 
    select(route_id, supermetroid_label) %>% 
    group_by(route_id) %>% 
    mutate(route_order = 1:n()) %>% 
    mutate(route_label = if_else(route_id == comparison_route, 
                                 "comparison_route", "possible_subroute")) %>%
    ungroup() %>% 
    select(-route_id) %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = route_label, values_from = route_order)

# inspect
pivoted_routes

# now filter for overlapping events
compared_routes <- pivoted_routes %>% 
    # filter 
    filter(!is.na(comparison_route) & !is.na(possible_subroute)) %>% 
    # arrange by possible subroute 
    arrange(possible_subroute) %>% 
    # and assign order
    mutate(possible_order = 1:n()) %>% 
    # arrange by comparison route order
    arrange(comparison_route) %>% 
    mutate(comparison_order = 1:n(),
           order_eq = possible_order == comparison_order)

# inspect
compared_routes


# now check to see if they're all true
all(pivoted_routes$order_eq)

# check to see if all elements of possible subroute are in compared route
# otherwise, could match one to many for route classes


```

Now we know if they have the same overlapping subroutes, and if `possible_subroute` has elements that `comparison_route` has.

## Identify the one to many subroutes

```{r out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("route_many_to_one.jpg")
```

If a subroute maps one to many, we need to disregard it. 

Need a list of a every combinatorial pairing. 

```{r}
viable_route_id <- viable_routes %>% 
  pull(route_id)

comparison_id_df <- expand.grid(viable_route_id, viable_route_id) %>% 
  rename(comparison_route = Var1, possible_subroute = Var2) %>% 
  filter(comparison_route != possible_subroute) %>%
  arrange(comparison_route) %>% 
  mutate(
    comparison_id = str_c(
      "c ", str_extract(comparison_route, "\\d+"),
      " p ", str_extract(possible_subroute, "\\d+") 
    )
  )

# take a look at combinations
comparison_id_df %>% head()


# how many combinations would we expect?
# number of routes * 1 less number of routes 
# because we won't compare a route with itself
length(viable_route_id) * (length(viable_route_id) - 1) 

# comfirm number of comparisons
comparison_id_df %>% 
  nrow()

# whoa combinatorics! 

```


Now we need to compare each route. We want to apply a function that calls each 
route and applies a comparison. We need to return a few pieces of information.

Probably some kind of `map_df` that returns:
  1. if `possible_classroute` (because it might not be a subroute) 
  2. lengths of two routes
  3. if `possible_classroute` is an absolute subroute 
  4. if `possible_classroute` 
  
We need to find out if `possible_classroute` 

```{r}

```
